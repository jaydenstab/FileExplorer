Rhetoric is the art of persuasive communication. It involves using language effectively to convince, inform, or motivate an audience. The three main modes of persuasion are ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic). Good writing requires understanding these rhetorical strategies and applying them appropriately.
