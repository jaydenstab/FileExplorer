## Jayden:
- Pagination on the frontend
- Make UI to open files less intrusive: have the file preview on the side
  instead of a dialog box
- Progress bar and in general, better feedback for the user as to what the
  backend is doing. e.g. a status bar at the bottom-left that shows what the 
  backend is working on.
- Adjustable thresholds??????????
- Back burner: Make UI more file-explorer-like?

## Victor:
- Investigate reranking / other methods of determining document relevance. Mess
  with metrics for chunk matching?
- Progress bar (both a backend and frontend thing)
- Back burner: index webpages and images? --> add a mechanism to the backend
  that lets people filter down on what types of files are in their index
- Make sure there's a threshold for indexing, don't want giant files to return for everything
